# Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano 2015 
## Scores Analysis

by Eric Ho

## Introduction

During the summer of 2015, I was a teaching fellow for Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano, a program that serves
underprivileged but highly motivated students in San Juan Capistrano by providing them summer instruction, tutoring 
during the school year, and counseling through the college admissions process. As an 8th grade math teaching fellow,
I had the pleasure of teaching my students pre-algebra and watching them improve.

Before the program started, the students took an online assessment (pre-test) facilitated by Renaissance Learning, Inc. Towards
the end of the program, the students took a similar assessment (post-test) to see how much they have learned. All the
teaching fellows were provided with their students' data. I was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of information that
online assessments could provide - I could not only see my students' improvement but also how much time they spent on the
exam!

Hence that August, I decided to delve into the data to see what I could glean. The sample size is very small, but there
are some interesting patterns which emerged. 

## Datasets

Above is a dataset that I created from the Renaissance Place assessment reports. I combined the students in
both of my classes (seven students each, for 14 total).

* **Student** column lists the students. For anonymity, I have used their initials.
* **Pre-Test** column lists pre-program scores.
* **Post-Test** column lists post-program scores.
* **MathChange** column is the difference between post-test and pre-test scores (a positive number denotes improvement).
* **Time** column lists time spent on the exam in minutes
* **PercentileRank** column lists the percentile the students falls in, based on nationwide scores.
* The other columns denote scores on subsections of the test.

Below is a dataset with the same students (except for outliers and missing students - I could not procure English score
data for all of my students), but with their English test scores included.

## Time

I thought the most interesting data available was the Time data. Some of my students finished early while others took their time.
I decided to see whether time made a difference.

#### Time vs. Math Change

Does time taken on a test affect the overall change in math scores? I ran a regression to find out.

```
#Time vs. MathChange
ggplot(data = BTdata, aes(x = Time, y = MathChange))+
  geom_point(shape=3) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+labs(x='Time (minutes)',y='Change in Math Scores') + 
  ggtitle("Time vs. Change in Math Scores")
```

It appears that there is a positive correlation between time spent on the exam and the change in math scores. It is possible that the bottom leftmost observation
is an outlier (one of my students finished rather early). The ANOVA F statistic suggests that a linear relationship is significant at the 0.10 level. Finally,
a residual plot suggests slight clustering but otherwise confirms that a linear model is a decent fit. So while the linear relationship is not extremely
significant (especially with the small sample size), it is still an okay fit. If anything, time certainly doesn't hurt one's math scores, although whether
it actually improves scores is still an unanswered question. 

#### Time vs. Percentile

Now, what about time versus percentile rank? How does time on the test affect one's percentile rank compared to students nationwide?

```
#Time vs. Percentile
ggplot(data = BTdata, aes(x = Time, y = PercentileRank))+
  geom_point(shape=3) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+labs(x='Time (minutes)',y='PercentileRank') + 
  ggtitle("Time vs. PercentileRank")
```

Unlike the previous graph, there does not appear to be any significant outliers. However, the results are roughly the same in that the linear relationship
is only significant at the 0.10 level. Like the previous analysis, the residual plot shows slight clustering but otherwise suggests that the linear model
is an acceptable fit. Again, it certainly does not hurt to spend a little more time on the exam.

## Subsection Scores

Each student report also contains information on how well each student performed in each subsection. The subsections are out of 100 and are named 

* Algebra
* Functions
* Geometry
* Numbers and Operations
* Statistics and Probability

#### Correlation Matrix
```

keeps <- c("Algebra", "Functions", "Geometry", "Numbers.Operations", "Statistics.Probability")
cordata <- subset(BTdata, select = keeps)
cor(cordata)

```

The correlation matrix above suggests that content mastery in one area correlates very significantly with success in another area. For example,
students who perform well in "Algebra" are more likely to also perform well in "Functions." This definitely suggests that teachers should focus on
helping students draw relationships between different math domains or concepts instead of treating these subsections as separate subjects. 
In more basic areas of math like pre-algebra, many concepts are much more closely tied together. 

#### Stacked Bar Graph

I decided to graph my students' performance (both in general and on each subsection) using a stacked bar plot. A cursory glance suggests that for a given
student, his or her performance on a subsection was roughly equal to his or her performance on other subsections. This would seem to reinforce the previous
finding that performances on subsections are positive correlated with one another.

```
cbPalette <- c('#ff6d6d','#8dff35','#ff9b35','#003fff',"#eee40d")
p=ggplot(data = longdat, aes(x = Student, y = Score, fill = Subsections)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity")+labs(x='Students', y = 'Scores', fill = 'Subsection') + ggtitle("Subsection Scores")+ scale_fill_manual(values=cbPalette)
p

```

## Just Curious: Math versus Reading

Teachers were not provided with detailed information regarding their students' performances on other subjects. I decided to canvass my English teachers
colleagues for the English scores of my students. Perhaps I might find some interesting pattern between math and reading scores.

```
ggplot(data = BTdata2, aes(x = MathChange, y = ReadingChange))+
  geom_point(shape=3) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+labs(x='Change in Math Scores',y='Change in Reading Scores') + 
  ggtitle("Change in Math Scores vs. Change in Reading Scores")

```

_Two observations were omitted because of lack of information or outliers_.
Compared to the previous graphs, the observations here exhibit fairly wide spread (variance) across the regression line. Despite this spread, though, the
residual plot exhibits less clustering and more randomness compared to the residual plots of the other graphs. In fact, the significance level of the
regression is lower (about 0.059) than the levels for the previous analyses. Who would've guessed? There's a pretty good linear model for these scores!

## Conclusion

Although my sample size was very small, I still had a lot of fun looking into the data and seeing which conclusions could be drawn. It seems that it does
pay off to spend a little extra time on exams since it positively correlates (however weakly) with test score improvements and percentile rank. My
analysis of the subsection scores also seems to confirm the importance of a solid foundation to prepare students for a rigorous math curriculum. Subjects in math are greatly correlated
with one another, so it makes sense to ensure that students understand all parts, since success in one area could lead to success in other parts. I am happy
to say that I have learned as much from my students as they have (hopefully) learned from me!
