# Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano 2015 
## Scores Analysis

by Eric Ho

### Introduction

During the summer of 2015, I was a teaching fellow for Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano, a program that serves
underprivileged but highly motivated students in San Juan Capistrano by providing them summer instruction, tutoring 
during the school year, and counseling through the college admissions process. As an 8th grade math teaching fellow,
I had the pleasure of teaching my students pre-algebra and watching them improve.

Before the program started, the students took an online assessment (pre-test) facilitated by Renaissance Learning, Inc. Towards
the end of the program, the students took a similar assessment (post-test) to see how much they have learned. All the
teaching fellows were provided with their students' data. I was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of information that
online assessments could provide - I could not only see my students' improvement but also how much time they spent on the
exam!

Hence that August, I decided to delve into the data to see what I could glean. The sample size is very small, but there
are some interesting patterns which emerged.
