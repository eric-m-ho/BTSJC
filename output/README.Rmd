# Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano 2015 
## Scores Analysis

by Eric Ho

### Introduction

During the summer of 2015, I was a teaching fellow for Breakthrough San Juan Capistrano, a program that serves
underprivileged but highly motivated students in San Juan Capistrano by providing them summer instruction, tutoring 
during the school year, and counseling through the college admissions process. As an 8th grade math teaching fellow,
I had the pleasure of teaching my students pre-algebra and watching them improve.

Before the program started, the students took an online assessment (pre-test) facilitated by Renaissance Learning, Inc. Towards
the end of the program, the students took a similar assessment (post-test) to see how much they have learned. All the
teaching fellows were provided with their students' data. I was pleasantly surprised at the wealth of information that
online assessments could provide - I could not only see my students' improvement but also how much time they spent on the
exam!

Hence that August, I decided to delve into the data to see what I could glean. The sample size is very small, but there
are some interesting patterns which emerged. 

### Datasets

Above is a dataset that I created from the Renaissance Place assessment reports. I combined the students in
both of my classes (seven students each, for 14 total).

* **Student** column lists the students. For anonymity, I have used their initials.
* **Pre-Test** column lists pre-program scores.
* **Post-Test** column lists post-program scores.
* **MathChange** column is the difference between post-test and pre-test scores (a positive number denotes improvement).
* **Time** column lists time spent on the exam in minutes
* **PercentileRank** column lists the percentile the students falls in, based on nationwide scores.
* The other columns denote scores on subsections of the test.

Below is a dataset with the same students (except for outliers and missing students - I could not procure English score
data for all of my students), but with their English test scores included.

### Time

I thought the most interesting data available was the Time data. Some of my students quite early while others took their time.
I decided to see whether time made a difference.

#### Time vs. Math Change

Does time taken on a test affect the overall change in math scores? I ran a regression to find out.

```
#Time vs. MathChange
ggplot(data = BTdata, aes(x = Time, y = MathChange))+
  geom_point(shape=3) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+labs(x='Time (minutes)',y='Change in Math Scores') + 
  ggtitle("Time vs. Change in Math Scores")
```

#### Time vs. Percentile

```
#Time vs. Percentile
ggplot(data = BTdata, aes(x = Time, y = PercentileRank))+
  geom_point(shape=3) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)+labs(x='Time (minutes)',y='PercentileRank') + 
  ggtitle("Time vs. PercentileRank")
```

### Subsection Scores

#### Correlation Matrix
```{r eval=TRUE}
library(data.table)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)

setwd("C:/Users/Eric/Desktop/BTSJC")

BTdata<-fread("BTSJCData.csv")

keeps <- c("Algebra", "Functions", "Geometry", "Numbers.Operations", "Statistics.Probability")
cordata <- subset(BTdata, select = keeps)
cor(cordata)

```
